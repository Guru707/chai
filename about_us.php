                  <p class="text-white">Wondering how a sales executive takes a u-turn and opens a Chai shop? </p>
                  <p class="text-white">The pandemic has been a life-changing experience for most of us. I lost my
                     comfortable, 9 to 5, 6 digit salary job in a matter of a day. Immediately I started looking for a
                     new job, hoping my degree and work experience would get me a job in no time. However, I ran out of
                     luck with getting only a few responses, and those who did revert were offering jobs that were not
                     good enough. After 3 months bored at home, I decided to change the scene and went to my nearest 
                     Chai Tapri because I got bored with my home Tea.
                     There I saw the chaiwala not following the guideline precautionary measures to make the tea, which
                     concerned me. There I got my idea, serving
                     Chai with hygiene. After doing research, the challenge is there are too many big giants currently
                     serving tea but their menu is not affordable to all. I came across two challenges. First, how to
                     make this brand affordable so that everyone can drink Chai - from Rickshaw drivers to the Luxury
                     car owners. And the second challenge was how to make it more hygienic.</p>

                  <p class="text-white">To keep pocket-friendly Hygiene, it was crucial to open a proper Chai outlet,
                     not a Stall/Tapri, and to target the Rickshaw Driver to the Luxury Car Owner, quality must be
                     maintained at Rs. 10/-. The new normal life is concentrated towards the hygiene factor as well as
                     affordable chai for all. Keeping that in mind Chai Patram came into conception, making untouched
                     chai that was hygienic, and affordable for all.</p>
